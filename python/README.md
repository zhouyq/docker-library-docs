# What is Python?

Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, open-source programming language. It incorporates modules, exceptions, dynamic typing, very high level dynamic data types, and classes. Python combines remarkable power with very clear syntax. It has interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to various window systems, and is extensible in C or C++. It is also usable as an extension language for applications that need a programmable interface. Finally, Python is portable: it runs on many Unix variants, on the Mac, and on Windows 2000 and later.

# How to use this image

## Create a `Dockerfile` in your Python app project

```dockerfile
FROM riscv64/python:3

WORKDIR /usr/src/app

COPY requirements.txt ./
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

CMD [ "python", "./your-daemon-or-script.py" ]
```

or (if you need to use Python 2):

```dockerfile
FROM riscv64/python:2

WORKDIR /usr/src/app

COPY requirements.txt ./
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

CMD [ "python", "./your-daemon-or-script.py" ]
```

You can then build and run the Docker image:

```console
$ docker build -t my-python-app .
$ docker run -it --rm --name my-running-app my-python-app
```

## Run a single Python script

For many simple, single file projects, you may find it inconvenient to write a complete `Dockerfile`. In such cases, you can run a Python script by using the Python Docker image directly:

```console
$ docker run -it --rm --name my-running-script -v "$PWD":/usr/src/myapp -w /usr/src/myapp riscv64/python:3 python your-daemon-or-script.py
```

or (again, if you need to use Python 2):

```console
$ docker run -it --rm --name my-running-script -v "$PWD":/usr/src/myapp -w /usr/src/myapp riscv64/python:2 python your-daemon-or-script.py
```

## Multiple Python versions in the image

In the non `python:slim` variants there will be an additional older `python` executable at `/usr/bin/python` while the desired newer `/usr/local/bin/python` is the default choice in the `$PATH`. This is an unfortunate side-effect of using the `buildpack-deps` image in the non-slim variants
